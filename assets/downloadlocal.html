	<h2>How To Download</h2>

	<p>To import a database or music pack into Droidound, you have a couple of options;</p>

	<p></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Download the zip-file directly from here using your phone,
			and click on it once it's been downloaded by the download manager. It
			should either be imported directly by Droidsound, or you will get a
			dialog indicating which program should handle the file. In the latter
			case (obviously) select Droidsound.</li>
		<li>Download the file to your PC, and copy it directly into your
			SD cards MODS/ directory (either over USB or with a dedicated sdcard
			reader). It should automatically be scanned next time you start
			Droidsound.</li>
		<li>Also, a well-behaved file manager (on your phone) should
			respect the configured MIME types and also let Droidsound open
			zip-files. This is not always the case though (for instance, Galaxy S
			built-in manager fails at this).</li>
	</ul>
