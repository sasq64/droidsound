WHAT YOU NEED

* Eclipse
* Android SDK, Android NDK r5 (or later), Android Platform 2.2 (or later)

HOW TO BUILD
 
 * Make sure your Eclipse/Android environment is set up correctly (all information you need is at http://developer.android.com)
 * Build the native libraries - run the NDK 'ndk-build' script from the project directory
 * Build the project normally from inside Eclipse (don't forget F5 = Refresh - or native libs will not be found)
 


ANDROID SDK ETC, DETAILED INSTALLATION

Go to http://developer.android.com/sdk/

* Download and unpack the Android SDK (android-sdk_r08 or later)
* Download and unpack the Android NDK (android-ndk-r5 or later)
* Run the "android" application from the android-sdk_r08/tools/
* Select Available Sites, Android Repository
* Install the latest version of the SDK Platform-tools (r01) and the SDK Platform (2.2 or later)

From within the project directory

* Run "<sdk>/tools/android update project -p <path to droidsound>"
* Run "<ndk>/ndk-build" to build the native libraries
* Run "ant debug" to build the APK-file into bin/

To Test it:

* Make sure you have USB-divers for your device and it is connected
* Run "<sdk>/platform-tools/adb devices". You should see your device listed.
* Run "<sdk>/platform-tools/adb install -r bin/droidsound-debug.apk" 
* Run "<sdk>/platform-tools/adb shell am start -n com.ssb.droidsound/.PlayerActivity"


To Test it (continued).
*Within Eclipse, if you simply hit the Run button with your android device connected (remember to turn USB Debugging on). It should push the application right onto your device.
