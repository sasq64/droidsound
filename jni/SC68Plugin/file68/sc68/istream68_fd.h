/** Creates a stream for "UNIX" file descriptor.

 *
 *  @param  fname  path of file or 0.
 *  @param  fd     file decriptor or -1.
 *  @param  mode   bit-0: read access, bit-1: write access.
 *
 *  @return stream
 *  @retval 0 on error
 *
 *  @note     filename is internally copied.
 *  @note     Even if fd is given the istream68_open() must be call.
 *  @warning  When opening a stream with an already opened descriptor the
 *            mode should match the real open mode but since no tests are
 *            performed before calling r/w access, it should not failed in
 *            case of wrong access on given mode.
