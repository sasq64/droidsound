The "vice" directory contains the untouched VICE source files.

The "android" directory contains the android platform support.

The "overrides" directory contains stubbed implementations for various pieces
of VICE in order to avoid compiling the support for all the extensions and
peripherals.

The "doc" directory contains some documentation files from the actual VICE SVN.
This is simply for those that are curious of how VICE does its emulation.
A lot of the documentation is also within the source files themselves.

The various .h files in this directory are generated by autotools, VICE, or
javah.
