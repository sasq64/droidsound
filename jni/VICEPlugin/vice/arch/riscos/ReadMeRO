To build VICE 1.5 or newer for RISC OS you need:

1) GCC 2.7.2 and Nick Burrett's SharedCLib stubs (the sound code relies on the
   SCL, you can't use UnixLib unless you replace all the timer_callback* calls).

2) wimplib 0.10, available from http://www.forwiss.tu-muenchen.de/~dehmel/Software.html.
   Copy wimplib into this directory (arch.riscos) or modify the Makefiles in 3).

3) ViceROKit, an archive containing RISC OS Makefiles and tools, also available
   from the address mentioned in 2).

4) The Templates / Messages files from the binary release if you want to change
   any icons or windows.

5) A Risc PC with at least 45 MB of free memory if you want to build all CPU-Files
   with full optimization.
